## Key Features
This project offers several exciting features to enhance the player experience in both single-player and multiplayer modes. Below is a detailed breakdown:

### 1. Game Modes
- **Single-Player Mode**: Players can practice solving N-Queens puzzles at their own pace, improving their problem-solving skills.
- **Multiplayer Mode**: Create rooms and compete in real-time with friends by sharing a room link.

### 2. Real-Time Functionality
- **Live Game Updates**: Players can see real-time updates when a game starts, when solutions are submitted, and when a round ends.
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time data synchronization ensures smooth multiplayer interaction.

### 3. Enhanced Puzzle Rules
- **Objective**: Place exactly one Queen in each row, column, and color region.
- **Interactive Controls**: Players can tap once to place an **X** (to block invalid squares) and tap twice to place a **Queen**.
- **No-Touch Rule**: Two Queens cannot touch each other, not even diagonally, ensuring challenging puzzle dynamics.

- **Profile Tracking**: Player stats, such as total points and fastest solving time, are linked to user profiles.

### 7. Responsive User Interface
- The frontend is designed to work seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices, allowing players to join and compete from any platform.

### 8. API and Backend Integration
- **REST API Endpoints**: PocketBase handles backend data storage with APIs for managing rooms, game rounds, and leaderboards.
- **Solution Validation**: Player solutions are validated on the backend to ensure correctness before awarding points.

### 9. Docker Support (Optional)
- A Dockerfile is provided to containerize the PocketBase backend and Node.js server, simplifying deployment and scalability.

### 10. AI-Assisted Development
- This project leverages **Cursor**, an AI-assisted IDE, to streamline coding, testing, and deployment, enhancing productivity.

## Planned Features (Future Enhancements)
- **Custom Board Sizes**: Allow room creators to choose different board sizes (e.g., 10x10, 12x12).
- **Player Stats and Achievements**: Add more detailed player stats and achievements to reward high performance.
- **In-Game Chat**: Implement a chat feature for multiplayer rooms to enhance social interaction.
- **Matchmaking (Optional)**: Automatic pairing of players with similar skill levels.
